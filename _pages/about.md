I am a research intern at [TUM ATARI Lab](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/aipd/home/), working with Prof. [Majid Khadiv](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/khadiv-majid). Starting January 2025, I will join [NYU Machines In Motion Laboratory](https://www.machinesinmotion.org/) as a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering, co-adivsed by Prof. [Ludovic Righetti](https://righetti.github.io/) and Prof. Majid Khadiv. My research interests lie in optimization-based control for legged robots and bionic mechanical design of humanoid robots.

Previously, I obtained my BEng in Mechatronics and Robotic Systems from the University of Liverpool and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) in 2023, advised by Prof. [Yuqing Chen](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=T4fF7coAAAAJ&hl=en).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
