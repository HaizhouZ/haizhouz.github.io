  abstract = {Wheeled bipedal robots (WBRs) have the capability to execute agile
              and versatile locomotion tasks. This paper focuses on improving the
              dynamic performance of WBRs through innovations in both hardware
              and software development. Inspired by the human barbell squat, a
              bionic mechanical design is proposed and implemented as shown in
              Fig. 1. It distributes the weight onto its hip and knee joints to
              improve the effectiveness of joint motors while maintaining a
              relatively large workspace of the base link. Meanwhile, a novel
              model-based controller is devised, synthesizing height-variable
              wheeled linear inverted pendulum (HV-wLIP) model, Control Lyapunov
              Function (CLF) and whole-body dynamics for theoretically guaranteed
              stability and efficient computation. Compared with other
              alternatives, as a more accurate approximation of the WBR dynamics,
              the HV-wLIP can enable more agile response and provide theory basis
              for WBR controller design. Experimental results demonstrate that
              the robot could perform human-like deep squat, and is capable of
              maintaining tracking CoM velocity while manipulating base states.
              Furthermore, it exhibited robustness against external disturbances
              and unknown terrains even in the wild.},

  abstract = {The legged robots with variable stiffness actuators (VSAs) can
              achieve energy-efficient and versatile locomotion. However,
              equipping legged robots with VSAs in real-world application is
              usually restricted by (i) the redundant mechanical structure design
              , (ii) limited stiffness variation range and speed, (iii) high
              energy consumption in stiffness modulation, and (iv) the lack of
              online stiffness control structure with high performance. In this
              paper, we present a novel Variable-Length Leaf-Spring Actuator
              (VLLSA) designed for legged robots that aims to address the
              aforementioned limitations. The design is based on leaf-spring
              mechanism and we improve the structural design to make the proposed
              VSA (i) compact and lightweight in mechanical structure, (ii)
              precise in theoretical modeling, and (iii) capable of modulating
              stiffness with wide range, fast speed, low energy consumption and
              high control performance. Hardware experiments including in-place
              and forward hopping validate advantages of the proposed VLLSA.},

  abstract = {Most interesting problems in robotics (e.g., locomotion and
              manipulation) are realized through intermittent contact with the
              environment. Due to the perception and modeling errors, assuming an
              exact time for establishing contact with the environment is
              unrealistic. On the other hand, handling uncertainties in contact
              timing is notoriously difficult as it gives rise to either handling
              uncertain complementarity systems or solving combinatorial
              optimization problems at run-time. This work presents a novel
              optimal control formulation to find robust control policies under
              contact timing uncertainties. Our main novelty lies in casting the
              stochastic problem to a deterministic optimization over the
              uncertainty set that ensures robustness criterion satisfaction of
              candidate pre-contact states and optimizes for contact-relevant
              objectives. This way, we only need to solve a manageable standard
              nonlinear programming problem without complementarity constraints
              or combinatorial explosion. Our simulation results on multiple
              simplified locomotion and manipulation tasks demonstrate the
              robustness of our uncertainty-aware formulation compared to the
              nominal optimal control formulation.},

  abstract = {Incorporating a robotic manipulator into a wheel-legged robot
              enhances its agility and expands its potential for practical
              applications. However, the presence of potential instability and
              uncertainties presents additional challenges for control
              objectives. In this paper, we introduce an arm-constrained
              curriculum learning architecture to tackle the issues introduced by
              adding the manipulator. Firstly, we develop an arm-constrained
              reinforcement learning algorithm to ensure safety and stability in
              control performance. Additionally, to address discrepancies in
              reward settings between the arm and the base, we propose a
              reward-aware curriculum learning method. The policy is first
              trained in Isaac gym and transferred to the physical robot to do
              dynamic grasping tasks, including the door-opening task,
              fan-twitching task and the relay-baton-picking and following task.
              The results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively
              controls the arm-equipped wheel-legged robot to master dynamic
              grasping skills, allowing it to chase and catch a moving object
              while in motion. Please refer to our website
